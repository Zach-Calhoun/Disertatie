-- establish reference faces -- need expression analysis :(
-- use relative landmark movements instead of transfering them -> might improve results - sctratcg that not feasible

-- establish unique faces in source - done
-- search for matches in target - done


-- transform points relatively instead of absolutely - see above, no go


-- figure what to do with mouth and closed eyes - fixed by local poisson cloning

-- what do with lightning changes -- solved -- poison cloning

-- effects needs to be localized per feature and blended and scaled to prevent horrible deformations - solution lower




TODO:::::

REFACTOR, need to add serios OOP as the mental load is already to much when returning from day to day
Implement head pose estimator - should fix rotation issue, current system is insuficient
Implement better scaling
    IDEA: When mapping facial features from one head to another, certain points must remain static
    For mouth use lips COM as simetry should be sufficient, but, account for matching edges of coresponding jaw landmarks for cases of side translatiion
    Nose should match top and bottom points
    For eyes and eyebrows, an assembly of eyse center should be used as pivots for moving around eyes & eyebrows as to solve distance issues
